## Documentation

Ensure you include jQuery and Bootstrap javascript on your page. Because people use many different versions of 
jQuery this module does *not* make any assumptions as to what version you are using.

Suggested code to be included in `Page.ss`

```html

<!-- In your template -->
<% include Carousel %>


<!-- In the header or end of body - jQuery first, then Popper.js, then Bootstrap JS -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js"
        integrity="sha384-KJ3o2DKtIkvYIK3UENzmM7KCkRr/rE9/Qpg6aAZGJwFDMVNA/GpGFF93hXpG5KkN"
        crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
